Hi Chuck, sorry to bother you — when you have a moment, could you please help review the DFM for the item below? Thank you in advance!
Hi Chuck, regarding Primo's TCD — at the BFT2 station, I’m wondering whether we need to add more "Read 56V Over I2C" test items.
What would be the process to do mini GRR if we only have 1x known good unit?
Could u send me the result file for loop 58?
Based on the x60 loop data, its OK to skip path loss measurement and use the previous path loss that we calculated before.
For the x1 Tx Cal failure, it appears to be docker disconnected or connection issues  and not a device functional failures. Therefore based on the x60 loop data, I'm good move on to next qualification steps
Understand the program urgency. However, MTE team owns fixture qualification. Its a risk since it's brand new chamber.
Thank you, Joshua. I do not have any concern based on the data.
is what I think it should be
Can't do any sort of qualification with only x1 device. Hence, I will look into CPK based on this x60 loops. Give me 15mins!
Please complete the validation listed in this Jira by today. We need this data to make a decision on switching to the new Docker version to support ARF and AFT parallel testing.2 and 4 slots be totally different? If not, I would like to review both.
If we are uploading from golden image to 5.0.3, do we need a intermediate version in between?
Should be out in a few minutes
Also from automation perspective, can the pick-N-place of the boards be in parallel for x4/x2 up rather than handling them one at a time? 
On the other hand, for the first coming build of the HVT1 Combo which is estimated to be next week, may we know if we shall use the build phase name as "HVT1_PLUS"?
For the build phase let me discuss internally tomorrow how we want to group these for naming
What's the this shielding box different from the one you have in CNT TW in term of internal dimension, RF freq isolation, etc.?
Is there a connector for GPS ANT at the back wall also?
What is the intent of the test? I see this Primo device is tested on Coco chamber while Primo chamber is sitting idle
Is it conshistent?
The logs on server side are not showing anything.  The error appears to be client side.  Have any of the client files been changed?
Hi everyone, my name is Charlie from CNT TE Team, I will being responsible for Primo project, taking over from Tim,
It's my pleasure to support and collaborate with every one. Nice to meet you!
If we are going prod to diag
To go from prod to diag, the Kazam sequence needs to call station/invalidate_partition, power cycle, and then call station/diag_to_diag
Can we verify that the Kazam sequence we are running is doing that?
But at swdl station we do not have station/invalidate_partition. So we need use p2 to do this

Can we prioritize this task to meet our deadline?
is there any chance we can get this done faster?
Would really help if we could move a bit quicker on this
This is quite urgent. Please prioritize and aim to complete it as soon as possible

Hi Kuiper team,

To work around the issue, we will use a retrofit fixture to address the issue
Moving on to FATP test, for AFT shielding box, In case, Angeton vendor is designated, the delivery time will be shorter.
so we suggest going with Angeton to catch up with schedule
If not, we need to follow normal purchasing process and it will be delayed and impact build
for this item, we are facing challenge
Next, Test carrier DFM has been approved and stay on schedule
Moving on,For Desense DMF will be approved on 28 and on schedule
No issue with SGP Simulator
For test trolly, we already removed it because Desense is designed for 1 up
CP antenna carrier has been approved and no issue
last one, for Zero Gauss, we also suggest going with Welltest vendor and we're having challenge

Hi Kuiper team, 
My name is Charlie form CNT TE Team. I will be responsible for Primo, taking over Tim, starting this week.

We will try to expedite the process
We’ll do our best to shorten the schedule
We will try to reduce lead time
Moving on to the AFT shielding box, In case, AGT vendor is designated by Kuiper, The delivery time will be shorter. I mean we will receive fixture sooner.

The combo board was changed on 4/22 so need to check with vendor whether DMF needs to be updated?
