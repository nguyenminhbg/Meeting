Overall, most items are currently on track
For BFT1, BFT2 and SWDL, they are under shipping and fabrication. However,as Chuck informed me earlier, we will have a design change. Add more 10 test points. So maybe we need to revise schedule for next week. And probably there will be time and cost impact. Now we are waiting for official information from Kuiper team.

Item 28, we've already received all of the carriers

For Item 29 and Item 31 (Desense and GPS simulator), they are ready to ship but have not yet been shipped because the PO is still not available. The target date for the PO to be ready is June 15th
For item 35, CP antenna, do we have any progress on that?

that's all for testing, nothing special to highlight

All test items will follow the schedule, except for SWDL and BFT1, which are expected to arrive later.
For test carrier, we have already received 8 out of 12 test retrofit carriers.
As per Kuiper's requirement, I will ask the supplier to kick off fabrication once the cost is approved.

In the latest BM, Ethernet Phy GI will be used
During flashing, in Extended CSD, ByteAddress 162 value default is '0'
The Ethernet Phy GI image has been successfully flashed with three vendors: Kioxia, Samsung, and Western.
However, I have a concern regarding address 162.
Currently, both Coco and Hugo have set the value of address 162 to '1'.
However, I have not yet received updated , so its value remains '0'
Kuiper team, please help confirm this

As talk in Wechat, the cost of swdl and bft have been approved. Please proceed with fabrication process to catch up with schedule

Regarding SWDL and BFT1 new buy, the cost's approved by Carlos on 5/22, we proceed with next process
For SWDL, BFT1 and BFT2 retrofit, their are no issue, status is on-going
As for AFT shielding box, We are facing the delay for 2 days and  AGT has confirmed that the current lead time is the shortest possible
To work around this issue, I suggest using the current AFT machine for early testing to avoid blocking build. Need Kuiper team to approve
There is no highlight for remaining fixture. all are on schedule
For CP antenna and waiveguide adapter,I sent an email to Kuiper Andrew for process confirmation last week=> the status is still waiting for Andrew's confirmation

In addition, we are planning to re-layout for Primo line. For testing, do you have any concerns
Hi Chuck,
Regarding AFT new buy, we are behind schedule for 2 days. Therefore, to work around this issue, we will use old AFT machine (current machine) in advance
Do you have any concerns about that. If no, tomorrow's meeting I will talk about that
For CP antenna and waiveguide adapter,I sent an email to Kuiper Andrew for confirmation last week=> still waiting Andrew's confirmation

@TE-Charlie (阮文明） @Eric Hsu due to Bojay issue of Hugo: 
1. BFT fixture (newbuy) has RGB analyse issue, lacking test point, DAQ can not test some Test points, RF probe connector quite short... Please review DFM again for not making any mistake before fabrication
2. OSS issue: Bojay only send Vietnamese staff to factory who can not handle the high level issue like: electrical issue, RF signal issue, color RGB issue, fixture control board issue -> please contact with them (Sophia these days OOO) for align the man resource of Primo. Chuck also wants vendor onsite can fix all problems
Soft remind:
Most of Primo fixture have had NRE, Please proceed with PO process. Don't delay schedule.
Confirmation on CP Antenna and Waveguide Adapter for ARF Station
Hi Andrew
My name is Charlie from CNT TE team and I'm responsible for Primo project
In preparation for Primo EVT, Regarding ARF station, we are planning to set up 4 CP antennas and 8 Waive Guide adapters on a ARF
Could you kindly help confirm the following:
1. Is the quantity of CP antennas and waveguide adapters correct?
2. Will these be provided by the Kuiper team? If so, what is the process for acquiring them?
lsiu@amazon.com
The quote from Bojay is 14,975.63 dolars, which is 100 dolars more expensive than Welltest
doble-side is 100 dollars more expensive than single-side
the double-side's price is 2X more expensive than we buy 2 single-side

Hi Kuiper team, I'm Charlie, I would like to update the E&F for testing.
firstly, Regarding SwDL and BFT1 2 up new buy, From Caslor's email, I understand that carlos is confused about this.
in terms of technical aspects, let me clarify about this
Actually, we need 2 up fixture to increase performance, UPH
So we have requested the vendor to make DFM with the old design, And we need to use double side for SwDL,
and we have provided the quotation to Carlos with double side design. 
After that, we had a design change last week. with the new design for swDL 2-up, it only requires a single side
And The cost will be changed and now we are waiting for new quotations from vendor. And will provide it as soon as we have it on hand

For SWDL, BFT1 and BFT2 retrofit, We have already informed Bojay to kick off fabrication on May 10th and it is on the schedule
For FATP part, all equipment and fixtures have been kicked off fabrication
And we are having slight delay with AFT shielding box and Zero Gauss Chamber, due to a lead time of 35 days, we are discussing with supplier 
to speed up fabrication. will provide confirmation next week
the remaining fixture status is on-going 


Actually, we need to buy a 2-up to increase UPH.
Chuck has approved the DFM for the 2-up.
Now we are waiting for quotations from both Bojay and Welltest and then update it to Kuiper


For SWDL and BFT1 2-up new buy, Let me classify it
Actually, we need to buy a 2-up to increase UPH. And We have already provided their quotation
Carlos has feedbacked that the quotation is too high
after that the Design has been changed and SWDL only need single side instead of double side
so the quotation will be changed and we will update it to Kuiper team


status is waiting for cost approval. and it will be delayed, to work around this issue
We will use retrofit fixture first to avoid blocking build
For SWDL, BFT1 and BFT2 retrofit, We have already informed Bojay to kick off fabrication on May 10th and it is on the schedule
For FATP part, all equipment and fixtures have been kicked off fabrication

Hi Team,
Regarding Primo testing, as aligned with the CNT Rel team, Rel has confirmed that FATP test will be skipped 500 cycles.
Therefore, TE will send all test carriers back to vendor for retrofit. This means there will be no test during carrier retrofit period.
Please take note!
Hi Chuck,
I would like to update you the DFMs
And have a concern:
TM20-TM27 is connected to RJ45 and TM32-TM39 also be connected to RJ45?

Yesterday, we encountered an issue with a copy IC. Of course, it wasn’t caused by us. you're doing a great job. However, I would like to kindly have a soft remind 
Be careful with the copy IC. It could become a serious issue if it happens on our side
Don't flash anything if you are not sure about it. Thank you so much!
Hi Chuck,
Because we updated new TCD today, so Bojay needs to revise the DFM. As a result, I still have not sent you the DFM yet
I would like to align with you about the DFM
1. SWDL will be probed on single side according to your email and TCD Test Points(for both the retrofit 1-up and new buy 2-up)
2. BFT1 will proceed with double-sided probing  (for both the retrofit 1-up and new buy 2-up)

Primo：
1. Device weight：1.090
2. Device carrier： 4.650
3.POE： 0.190

Hi Wood, Tomorrow morning We are planning to send 4 fixtures (SWDL 2x, BFT1 1x, BFT2 1x) back to Bojay VietNam retrofit.
So please help arrange manpower and time to implement it.
Regarding SWLD and BFT1 2up new buy, I asked cost PM to provided you and Carlos a quote for 1-up but seems she forgot that, let me push her to provide immediatelly
I would like to update the E&F Test Fixture status as follows:
1. For PCBA Testing, We will use retrofit fixture to catch up with the schedule
2. For FATP, we are having a bit delay with AFT shielding box and Zero Gauss Chamber (MAGCAL)(Ready for LBU on 6/27)
To work around with FATP delay, I will try to push supplier speed up fabrication to cover.
Please se the attached excel file for more details

Today Bojay provided the DFMs. However after reviewing, I asked to revise and will provide to you tomorrow
Hi Chuck,
I have received the new TCD version v0.2.1 from Wei. Is this the latest version?
In addition, as you mentioned previously, three more test points — TP424, TP425, and TP426 — have been added to the Combo board. However, I didn’t see them listed in the TCD Test Point.
Could you please help confirm this?
What function do those 3 test points test for?

To work around this issue, Once we get the cost approval, I will try to push supplier to speed up for retrofit fixture to catch up with the schedule.
Hi Chuck,
For SWDL, BFT1, and BFT2, They will provide DFM on 5/9
In parallel, Their quotation will be sent to Carlos to approve by today

Primo HVT3 build plan has been changed as follows:

1. Build config: HVT3-PR-COM7 will use "c0_golden_bl1.img" golden image (WO:2794000492). For this WO, I believe you don't need to update any thing.
2. Build config: HVT3-PR-CMSP will use "Ethernet Phy GI" golden image(WO: 2794000491, golden image will be available around 5/13), For this, you need to make a mother board for EMMC, right?

Hi wei,
as you know, the Power and Combo board will be changed design, there maybe be locked down today
so We need to update DFM and maybe the quotation will be also updated
I'm wondering whether EVT build plan push back or not
If no, it's really risk for CNT and especially TE
I also know we delay in quotation.

Hi Chuck,
I just checked my email, and it seems I still haven’t received an email from you.
Please re-forward to: charlie.wm.ruan@fii-foxconn.com

After reviewing the DFM, I noticed it doesn't align with the Gerber file
Upon reviewing the DFM, I found discrepancies between it and the Gerber file
Hi Chuck,
I asked Bojay to use the latest Gerber file to update the DFM for BFT2. However, I have a concern that I’d like to double-check with you
In the latest Gerber file, I didn’t see the test point (right side) as you mentioned. To make sure everything is correct, could you please guide me on how to view it? Thanks

I would like to update "Mangetic field test fixture (Magcal)" DFM.
Zero Gauss Chamber (Magcal) has been approved before. And here is fixture, which is used inside Zero Gauss Chamber
Please take a look and help approve if no concern.
Where is the latest Gerber file for this one?

I'm getting stuck with the quotation process, which could cause delays in the build. Could you help me with that?

We need to speed up the process to meet the deadline.
The team is working overtime to accelerate progress.
We hired more workers to expedite the construction.
Hi Chuck, sorry to bother you — when you have a moment, could you please help review the DFM for the item below? Thank you in advance!
Hi Chuck, regarding Primo's TCD, I’m wondering whether we need to add more "Read 56V Over I2C" test items into the BFT2 station.
Hi Chuck, As of now, we are having DFM not approved as follows:
1. SWDL Fixture-2x up
2. SWDL retrofit carrier
3. BFT1 Fixture-2x up
4. BFT1 retrofit carrier
5. AFT shielding box
6. Zero Gauss Chamber (same as Coco design, and Coco has been approved)
Please help review and approve the DFM if there are no concerns. Thank you so much!

What would be the process to do mini GRR if we only have 1x known good unit?
Could u send me the result file for loop 58?
Based on the x60 loop data, its OK to skip path loss measurement and use the previous path loss that we calculated before.
For the x1 Tx Cal failure, it appears to be docker disconnected or connection issues  and not a device functional failures. Therefore based on the x60 loop data, I'm good move on to next qualification steps
Understand the program urgency. However, MTE team owns fixture qualification. Its a risk since it's brand new chamber.
Thank you, Joshua. I do not have any concern based on the data.
is what I think it should be
Can't do any sort of qualification with only x1 device. Hence, I will look into CPK based on this x60 loops. Give me 15mins!
Please complete the validation listed in this Jira by today. We need this data to make a decision on switching to the new Docker version to support ARF and AFT parallel testing.2 and 4 slots be totally different? If not, I would like to review both.
If we are uploading from golden image to 5.0.3, do we need a intermediate version in between?
Should be out in a few minutes
Also from automation perspective, can the pick-N-place of the boards be in parallel for x4/x2 up rather than handling them one at a time? 
On the other hand, for the first coming build of the HVT1 Combo which is estimated to be next week, may we know if we shall use the build phase name as "HVT1_PLUS"?
For the build phase let me discuss internally tomorrow how we want to group these for naming
What's the this shielding box different from the one you have in CNT TW in term of internal dimension, RF freq isolation, etc.?
Is there a connector for GPS ANT at the back wall also?
What is the intent of the test? I see this Primo device is tested on Coco chamber while Primo chamber is sitting idle
Is it conshistent?
The logs on server side are not showing anything.  The error appears to be client side.  Have any of the client files been changed?
Hi everyone, my name is Charlie from CNT TE Team, I will being responsible for Primo project, taking over from Tim,
It's my pleasure to support and collaborate with every one. Nice to meet you!
If we are going prod to diag
To go from prod to diag, the Kazam sequence needs to call station/invalidate_partition, power cycle, and then call station/diag_to_diag
Can we verify that the Kazam sequence we are running is doing that?
But at swdl station we do not have station/invalidate_partition. So we need use p2 to do this

Can we prioritize this task to meet our deadline?
is there any chance we can get this done faster?
Would really help if we could move a bit quicker on this
This is quite urgent. Please prioritize and aim to complete it as soon as possible

To work around the issue, we will use a retrofit fixture to address the issue
Moving on to FATP test, for AFT shielding box, In case, Angeton vendor is designated, the delivery time will be shorter.
so we suggest going with Angeton to catch up with schedule
If not, we need to follow normal purchasing process and it will be delayed and impact build
for this item, we are facing challenge
Next, Test carrier DFM has been approved and stay on schedule
Moving on,For Desense DMF will be approved on 28 and on schedule
No issue with SGP Simulator
For test trolly, we already removed it because Desense is designed for 1 up

Hi Kuiper team, 
My name is Charlie form CNT TE Team. I will be responsible for Primo, taking over Tim, starting this week.

We will try to expedite the process
We’ll do our best to shorten the schedule
We will try to reduce lead time
Moving on to the AFT shielding box, In case, AGT vendor is designated by Kuiper, The delivery time will be shorter. I mean we will receive fixture sooner.
